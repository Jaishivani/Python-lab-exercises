Function to print Pascal's triangle:

def print_pascals_triangle(n):
    def generate_next_row(current_row):
        return [1] + [current_row[i] + current_row[i + 1] for i in range(len(current_row) - 1)] + [1]

    current_row = [1]
    for _ in range(n):
        print(current_row)
        current_row = generate_next_row(current_row)

print_pascals_triangle(5)
# Output:
# [1]
# [1, 1]
# [1, 2, 1]
# [1, 3, 3, 1]
# [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
